# This is a voice cloning model that uses sv2tts pre-trained model to generate audio output for the given prompt, having the characteristics of the target speaker.

### 1. Install Requirements
1. Both Windows and Linux are supported. A GPU is recommended for training and for inference speed, but is not mandatory.
2. Python 3.7 is recommended. Python 3.5 or greater should work, but you'll probably have to tweak the dependencies' versions. I recommend setting up a virtual environment using `venv`, but this is optional.
3. Install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#get-packages). This is necessary for reading audio files.
4. Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). Pick the latest stable version, your operating system, your package manager (pip by default) and finally pick any of the proposed CUDA versions if you have a GPU, otherwise pick CPU. Run the given command.
5. Install the remaining requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 2. (Optional) Download Pretrained Models
Manually download the PRETRAINED MODELS [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kz2nh6zjL3EnrvS8LF0Di2r2ZvW2N8rl?usp=sharing).
Copy these models to Real-Time-Voice-Cloning\saved_models\default.

### 3. (Optional) Test Configuration
Before you download any dataset, you can begin by testing your configuration with:

`python demo_cli.py`

If all tests pass, you're good to go.

### 4. (Optional) Download Datasets
For playing with the toolbox alone, I only recommend downloading [`LibriSpeech/train-clean-100`](https://www.openslr.org/resources/12/train-clean-100.tar.gz). Extract the contents as `<datasets_root>/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100` where `<datasets_root>` is a directory of your choosing. You're free not to download any dataset, but then you will need your own data as audio files or you will have to record it with the toolbox.

### 5. Launch the Toolbox
You can then try the toolbox:

`python demo_toolbox.py -d <datasets_root>`  
or  
`python demo_toolbox.py`
